RECH_Master

Table for both RECH and 35E2 models. They appear to be the same. TSI uses 35E2 models and I think OEM uses RECH.

Note: Not Intuitive
Chillers that have 4 circuits are represented with the columns of just the first 2 circuits; the columns for circuit 3 and 4 are ignored currently.
All the 4 circuit units have symmetric circuits so instead of repeating the data just the quantities were changed such as compressor quantity.
So basically the 4 circuit units are represented as 2 circuit units with twice the quantities.

Note:
SS and SD units have 1 condenser and SMs have 2 condensers.
